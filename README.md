## Summary

## Background

This app started out as a simple landing page for a fictional coffee shop & bakery, but has since evolved into a full-fledged e-commerce website. I decided to build an e-commerce app because I thought it would be a good learning exercise, particularly in the domain of front-end web development, as e-commerce websites often feature many different kinds of components.
